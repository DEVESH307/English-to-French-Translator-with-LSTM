# English to French Translator with LSTM

## Welcome!
Welcome to **"English to French Translation with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks"**. **Machine Translation (MT)** is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language.

## Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

1. Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
3. Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
4. Understand the concept of tokenizer.
5. Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
6. Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
7. Build and train the deep learning model
8. Access the performance of the trained model

## Project Structure
The hands on project on **English to French Translation with LSTM** is divided into following tasks:

### Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case
### Task #2: Import libraries and datasets
### Task #3: Perform Data Cleaning
### Task #4: Visualize the cleaned data
### Task #5: Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding
### Task #6: Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks
### Task #7: Understand the theory and intuition behind LSTM
### Task #8: Build and train the model
### Task #9: Assess trained model performance
